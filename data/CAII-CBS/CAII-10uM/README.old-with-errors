Titraion of carboxybenzenesulfonamide (CBS) into carbonic anhydrase II (CAII)

06 May 2011 

These experiments follow the control experiment performed in Myszka et al. ABRF MIRG'02.

PREPARATION PROTOCOL

* CAII

Carbonic anhydrase II was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (product C2522-25mg, lot #XXXXXXXXXXXX) in the form of lyophilized crystals.
4 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) buffer were dispensed from a 5 ml serological pipette into the container, gently pipetting to dissolve the protein.
1 mL was transferred into a 2.5 ml dialysis tube, to which an additional 1 mL of PBS buffer was added.
This tube was dialyzed overnight in a covered beaker filled with ~1 L PBS dialysis buffer.
Volume levels in the dialysis tube were visually inspected after dialysis and found to be similar.

To roughly assess the protein concentration post-dialysis, a 1:8 dilution was prepared by adding 20 uL of protein solution to 140 ul of PBS dialysis buffer and loading 100 uL into a cuvette with 10 mm path length and assayed in a UV-vis at 280 nm.
The absorbance was read to be 5.209 +- 0.1 A on the NanoDrop ND-1000.
Using an extinction coefficient of 50070 M^{-1} cm^{-1} provided by Sigma-Aldrich, this yielded a concentration of ~ 100 uM.

The 2 mL dialyzed protein solution was extracted from the tube and diluted with 8 mL dialysis PBS buffer to yield 10 mL of ~ 10 uM stock.
The concentration of this ~ 10 uM stock was assayed measuring the absorbance at 280 nm on the NanoDrop ND-1000, which was measured to be 0.457 +- 0.009 A, yielding a concentration of ~9.1 uM.

The dialysis buffer was recovered and filtered and stored at 4 C for use in preparing the CBS solution and in blank titrations.
pH re-measurement at ambient temperature verified the pH remained at 7.4.

* CBS

Carboxybenzenesulfonamide (CBS) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (4-sulfonylbenzoic acid at 97% purity, product 000944798, lot #MKBF3323V).  
To prepare a ~ 2 mM stock solution, 24.8 +- 0.1 mg were massed out onto a tared plastic weighing boat on an analytical balance.
The contents of the boat were added to a 50 ml Falcon tube, to which 34 +- 0.5 ml dialysis PBS buffer was added using a 50 ml serological pipette.
And additional 249 +- 2 ul PBS buffer was added using a 1000 ul micropipette, rinsing the boat to ensure all CBS was transferred into the Falcon tube.
The boat was again rinsed with 1000 ul of the contents of the Falcon tube using the same micropipette.
The Falcon tube was vortexed vigorously for ~ 10 min to ensure all visible solid was dissolved.

For this ~ 2 mM stock, a total of 24.8 +- 0.1 mg was dissolved in 34.2 +- 0.5 mL PBS, for a total concentration of 0.403 +- 0.007 g/L (~1.7% accuracy).
Using a MW for CBS of 201.2 g/mol, this gave a solution of 2.00 +- 0.03 mM.

The concentration of the ~ 2 mM stock was assayed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer to determine the absorbance at 272 nm.
A ~ 5 ul sample was loaded, and the absorbance was determined to be 0.260 +- 0.005 A using the path length of 1 mm.
Using an extinction coefficient of 1307 +- 126 M^{-1} cm^{-1} from Myzska et al., the concentration is determined to be 2.0 +- 0.2 mM.

To prepare ~446 uM CBS for loading in the syringe, 0.892 +- 2 ul of 2 mM CBS stock solution was dispensed into a 10 ml Falcon tube using a 200 ul pipetteman, to which 3.109 +- 5 uL ml dialysis PBS buffer was added using a 5000 ul pipetteman.
The resulting solution should have a concentration of 446 +- 1 uM by propagation of error.

Concentration of the ~ 446 uM for loading in the syringe was assayed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer to determine the absorbance at 272 nm.
A ~ 5 ul sample was loaded, and the absorbance determined to be 0.062 +- 0.001 A using the path length of 1 mm.
Using an extinction coefficient of 1307 +- 126 M^{-1} cm^{-1} from Myzska et al., the concentration is determined to be 474 +- 46 uM.

The concentration was also checked using a more accurate UV-vis spectrophotometer (model???) using a cuvette with a 10 mm path length.
The absorption at 272 nm was measured to be 0.59667 +- ?????? A, giving a concentration of 457 +- ??? uM.

ITC PROTOCOL 

Syringe: [CBS] 443 uM 
Sample cell: [CAII] 9.13 uM 

10 injections of 10 uL were used, with a 10 uL "syringe down" command issued prior to loading syringe into VP-ITC.
A 300 s pre-injection data recording period was used
Each injection was 20 s in duration, with 240 s between injections.
The experiment was performed at 25 C, with samples equilibrated to ~ 24 C prior to loading.
The room in which the instrument is located was thermostatted to 21 C.

CBS concentration determined from absorbance at 272 with NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer, using extinction coefficient 1307 +- 126 M^{-1} cm^{-1} from Myszka paper.
CAII concentration determined from absorbance at 280 nm with NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer, using extinction coefficient 50070 M^{-1} cm^{-1}.
Both CBS and CAII were dissolved in PBS pH 7.4 buffer from overnight dialysis of CAII sample.
