Carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) + carboxybenzenesulfonamide (CBS)

These experiments try to explore different protocols following the Myszka et al. ABRF MIRG'02 experiments.

For the 10 injection protocol the concentration was 38.4uM, uncorrected for the % purity of the protein stock. 
For the 15 injection protocol the concentration was 38.9uM. 
The concentration CBS was 1.950mM, w/o correcting for 97% purity (given by the supplier) using an extinction coefficient of 1307 M-1/cm at 272nm. 

Protocols:

10inject-40uM.inj - 10 injections of 10 uL
15inject-40uM.inj - 15 injections of 6.7 uL
20inject-40uM.inj - 20 injections of 5 uL

Experiment log:

042711a.itc - 10 injections of 10 uL
042711b.itc - 15 injections of 6.7 uL
042711c.itc - aborted blank titration (ligand into buffer) for 15 injection protocol
042711d.itc - blank titration (ligand into buffer) for 15 injection protocol
042711e.itc - 20 injections of 5 uL (bubble issues)
